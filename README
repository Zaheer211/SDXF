SDXF is a python library for creating lines, circles, and polygons in DXF (Document Exchange Format). DXF is an ASCII format published by AutoCAD and readable by a variety of programs.

The library was created by a guy named [Stani](http://www.stani.be) and appears to be abandoned. I couldn't find any documentation for it so I [wrote my own](http://www.kellbot.com/sdxf-python-library-for-dxf). It's not being actively maintained, but if you've got a bug fix feel free to fork it and submit a pull request.

If anyone wants to put together some test scripts to make sure things don't get broken along the way, please do!
